# Frontend Mentor - Results summary component solution

This is a solution to the [Results summary component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/results-summary-component-CE_K6s0maV), and my VERY FIRST Frontend Mentor challenges. Ready for my next one...

This read me is also the first one I've done for a Frontend Mentor project so it may be a litte rough. I'll probably re-edit after my next one as I get more comfortable with the format.

## My process

I really liked the look of the desktop version of this design, which is what caught my eye and pulled me into the challenge, so I did that first. I them refactored my CSS for a mobile first approach, using a min-width breakpoint of 775px. 


### Built with

My own hand-typed code using VS Code with some help from the Emmet extension. Tried to keep the code as simple and clean as possible, which is pretty much my approach to everything.

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

For me the big learning was getting familiar with Frontendmentor.io and the process for completing and uploading projects. Next step is to begin contributing to the community by offering feedback on other challenges.

As far as code is concerned, just good practice with Flexbox.

### Continued development

I will continue to build-on and practice my skills in HTML and CSS, probably just using Vanilla JavaScript right now for these projects when needed. I am picking up TailwindCSS now and so may use that soon. Then later using React for more JavaScript heavy challenges.
